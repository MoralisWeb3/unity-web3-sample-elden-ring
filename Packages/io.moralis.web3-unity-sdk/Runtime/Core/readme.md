# Moralis DOT NET SDK #
The files in this directory and in the child directories of this directory for the Moralis 
Dot Net SDK. These files should not be modified.

The raw files are included in this project to ensure compatibility with Unity 3D. While the official 
Nuget Package could be used, we have found that the pre-compiled DLLs can have some incompatibilities 
within some Unity3D applications, esp. when re-rendered as Objective C and compiled on iOS.
