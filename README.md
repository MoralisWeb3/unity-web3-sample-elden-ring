# ðŸŽ® Web3 Elden Ring Clone ðŸŽ®

Yes, you read that right. For this week's project, we cloned a boss fight in Elden Ring using Unity and Moralis. You're going to learn how to add Web3 elements to the gameplay, so the loot that the boss will drop will be ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens.

Specifically, we will first learn how the loot system is created. Then, how to transformate these loot items to ERC tokens and lastly, how to retrieve the now on-chain data to visualize it in the game menu.
